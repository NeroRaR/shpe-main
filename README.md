## SHPE Website 
### Description / Abstract
- *As part of our Software Development II course with Dr. Anca, our team has been developing SHPE Georgia, a modern web application designed to support the local chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) in Georgia. The goal of this project is to develop a web app that lets SHPE Georgia distribute information online and be able to automate their activities. So far, our team has created a functional login/signup/logout function, which will allow members and sponsors to log into using their unique member ids. We have a navigation system that enables users to navigate from page to page without any issues. We have essentially finished most of the groundwork for future teams to build upon this.
With this in mind, the scalable of our structure allows future extensions such as admin dashboards, resource uploads, and automated event reminders. The impact of this project lies in its ability to streamline chapter operations, strengthen community connection, and support the academic and professional growth of SHPE members across Georgia.*

### Technologies
- Frontend: React.js, Bootstrap
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, bcrypt.js, JSON Web Token (JWT)
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Version Control: Git / GitHub
- Environment: Node.js 18.17 or newer (20.x LTS recommended)
  
### Working Features
- Login System

We implemented a functional login system that allows users to securely access the platform. This provides the foundation for more advanced access control later.

Event Calendar and Event System

We created an event calendar where users can view upcoming events. The system supports adding, viewing, and updating events as needed.

- Scalable Architecture

The system is built in a way that supports future growth, such as higher membership counts and more event activity. New features can be added without major structural changes.

- User-Friendly Interface

We designed the interface to be simple and intuitive so all users, including first-time visitors, can navigate the site easily. The layout focuses on clarity and accessibility.

- Fast Page Response

Pages load smoothly and meet the expected performance target of loading within about five seconds under normal conditions. This improves the overall experience for users.

- Maintainable Modular Design

The system is organized into clear, modular components, making updates and debugging easier. Documentation supports future fixes and feature additions.
